## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

This is a simple portifolio page. The basic code was forked from UDACITY in [this link](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-mobile-portfolio).

## Optimization

In the index.html page I improve the CSS delivery using google pagespeed help page
[this link](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/OptimizeCSSDelivery).
I also use media querys to avoid the CSS blocking and async to avoid JavaScript blocking.

Ih the main.js I edit the function changePizzaSizes() following the instructions given
in the optmization classes. I changed updatePositions() function changing the variable
to modify the phase of the function that determines the position of the pizzas in the
background. I also change the max number of pizzas in the background.

## Instalation
You must a have a browser to open the pages. We recommend Chrome Browser.
Download all the files in this repo and open
index.html file to begin the game.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-mobile-portfolio
```
## Opening
Go to the folder where you cloned the application and
open the file 'index.html' using your browser. After
you will be able to navigate to several pages in the
portifolio.
